# K-means-Clustering-Distance
# K-means Clustering Using Different Distance Measure Technique and Defining Inter Cluster Similarity.

We can define similarity between two clusters using MIN, MAX, group average, distance between centroids, other methods driven
by an objective function like wardâ€™s method that uses squared error. This Project showcase variants
of k-means which uses an alternative distance measure . Also different K-Mean algorithms are also show cased various distribution of dataset to compare their outcomes
